:mod:`ftplib` no longer trusts the IP address value returned from the server
in response to the PASV command by default.  This prevents a malicious FTP
server from using the response to probe IPv4 address and port combinations
on the client network.

Code that requires the former vulnerable behavior may set a
``trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address`` attribute on their :class:`ftplib.FTP`
instances to ``True`` to re-enable it.

Fix Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in
:class:`urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler`.  The ReDoS-vulnerable
regex has quadratic worst-case complexity and it allows cause a denial of
service when identifying crafted invalid RFCs. This ReDoS issue is on the
client side and needs remote attackers to control the HTTP server.
