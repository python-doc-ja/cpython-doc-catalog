Fix configure error when building on macOS 11. Note that 3.7.8 was released
shortly after the first developer preview of macOS 11 (Big Sur); there are
other known issues with building and running on the developer preview. Big
Sur is expected to be fully supported in a future bugfix release of Python
3.8.x and with 3.9.0.
