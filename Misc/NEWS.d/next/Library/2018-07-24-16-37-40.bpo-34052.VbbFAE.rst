:meth:`sqlite3.Connection.create_aggregate`,
:meth:`sqlite3.Connection.create_function`,
:meth:`sqlite3.Connection.set_authorizer`,
:meth:`sqlite3.Connection.set_progress_handler` methods raises TypeError
when unhashable objects are passed as callable. These methods now don't pass
such objects to SQLite API. Previous behavior could lead to segfaults. Patch
by Sergey Fedoseev.
