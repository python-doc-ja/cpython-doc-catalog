Calling func:`shutil.copytree` to copy a directory tree from one directory
to another subdirectory resulted in an endless loop and a RecursionError. A
fix was added to consume an iterator and create the list of the entries to
be copied, avoiding the recursion for newly created directories. Patch by
Bruno P. Kinoshita.
