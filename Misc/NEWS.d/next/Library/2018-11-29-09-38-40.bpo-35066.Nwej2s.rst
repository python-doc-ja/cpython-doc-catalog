Previously, calling the strftime() method on a datetime object with a
trailing '%' in the format string would result in an exception. However,
this only occured when the datetime C module was being used; the python
implementation did not match this behavior. Datetime is now PEP-399
compliant, and will not throw an exception on a trailing '%'.
