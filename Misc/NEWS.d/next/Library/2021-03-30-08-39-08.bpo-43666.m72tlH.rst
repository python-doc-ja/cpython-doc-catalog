AIX: `Lib/_aix_support.get_platform()` may fail in an AIX WPAR.
The fileset bos.rte appears to have a builddate in both LPAR and WPAR
so this fileset is queried rather than bos.mp64.
To prevent a similiar situation (no builddate in ODM) a value (9988)
sufficient for completing a build is provided.
Patch by M Felt.
