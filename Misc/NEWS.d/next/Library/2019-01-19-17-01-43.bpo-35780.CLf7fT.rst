Fix lru_cache() errors arising in recursive, reentrant, or
multi-threaded code. These errors could result in orphan links and in
the cache being trapped in a state with fewer than the specified maximum
number of links.  Fix handling of negative maxsize which should have
been treated as zero.  Fix errors in toggling the "full" status flag.
Fix misordering of links when errors are encountered.  Sync-up the C
code and pure Python code for the space saving path in functions with a
single positional argument. In this common case, the space overhead of
an lru cache entry is reduced by almost half.  Fix counting of cache
misses. In error cases, the miss count was out of sync with the actual
number of times the underlying user function was called.
