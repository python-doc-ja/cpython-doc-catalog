Reinitialize logging.Handler locks in forked child processes instead of
attempting to acquire them all in the parent before forking only to be
released in the child process.  The acquire/release pattern was leading to
deadlocks in code that has implemented any form of chained logging handlers
that depend upon one another as the lock acquision order cannot be
guaranteed.
