A change was made to logging.config.dictConfig to avoid converting instances
of named tuples to ConvertingTuple. It's assumed that named tuples are too
specialised to be treated like ordinary tuples; if a user of named tuples
requires ConvertingTuple functionality, they will have to implement that
themselves in their named tuple class.
