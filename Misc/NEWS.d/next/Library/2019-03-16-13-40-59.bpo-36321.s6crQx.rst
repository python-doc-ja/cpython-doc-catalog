collections.namedtuple() misspelled the name of an attribute.  To be
consistent with typing.NamedTuple, the attribute name should have been
"_field_defaults" instead of "_fields_defaults".  For backwards
compatibility, both spellings are now created.  The misspelled version may
be removed in the future.
