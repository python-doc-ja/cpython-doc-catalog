Fixes a possible hang when using a timeout on `subprocess.run()` while
capturing output.  If the child process spawned its own children or
otherwise connected its stdout or stderr handles with another process, we
could hang after the timeout was reached and our child was killed when
attempting to read final output from the pipes.
