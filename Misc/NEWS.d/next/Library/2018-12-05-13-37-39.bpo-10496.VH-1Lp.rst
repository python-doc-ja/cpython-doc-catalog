:func:`posixpath.expanduser` now returns the input *path* unchanged if the
``HOME`` environment variable is not set and the current user has no home
directory (if the current user identifier doesn't exist in the password
database). This change fix the :mod:`site` module if the current user doesn't
exist in the password database (if the user has no home directory).
