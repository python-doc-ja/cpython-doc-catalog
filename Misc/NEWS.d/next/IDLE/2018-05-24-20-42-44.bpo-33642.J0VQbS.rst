IDLE: Only display actual code context lines.
Instead of displaying a fixed number of lines, some blank, Code Context
now displays the variable number of actual context lines.  When there
are no context lines, it shows a single blank line to indicate that the
feature is turned on.

The Code Context configuration option is changed from 'numlines'
(default 3) to 'maxlines' (default 15) to avoid possible interference
between user settings for the old and new versions of Code Context.
