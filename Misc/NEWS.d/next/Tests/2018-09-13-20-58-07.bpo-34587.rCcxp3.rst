test_socket: Remove RDSTest.testCongestion(). The test tries to fill the
receiver's socket buffer and expects an error. But the RDS protocol doesn't
require that. Moreover, the Linux implementation of RDS expects that the
producer of the messages reduces its rate, it's not the role of the receiver to
trigger an error. The test fails on Fedora 28 by design, so just remove it.
