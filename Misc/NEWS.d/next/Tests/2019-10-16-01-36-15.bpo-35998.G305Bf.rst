Fix a race condition in test_asyncio.test_start_tls_server_1(). Previously,
there was a race condition between the test main() function which replaces the
protocol and the test ServerProto protocol which sends ANSWER once it gets
HELLO. Now, only the test main() function is responsible to send data,
ServerProto no longer sends data.
