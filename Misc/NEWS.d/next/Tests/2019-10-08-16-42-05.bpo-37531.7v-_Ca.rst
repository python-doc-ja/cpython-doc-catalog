On timeout, regrtest no longer attempts to call ``popen.communicate()``
again: it can hang until all child processes using stdout and stderr pipes
completes. Kill the worker process and ignores its output. Change also the
faulthandler timeout of the main process from 1 minute to 5 minutes, for Python
slowest buildbots.
