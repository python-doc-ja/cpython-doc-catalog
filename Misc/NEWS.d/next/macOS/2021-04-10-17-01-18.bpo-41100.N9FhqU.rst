As of 3.8.10, Python now supports building and running on macOS 11
(Big Sur) and on Apple Silicon Macs (based on the ``ARM64`` architecture).
A new universal build variant, ``universal2``, is also available to natively
support both ``ARM64`` and ``Intel 64`` in one set of executables.
This backport from Python 3.9 does not include support for "weaklinking";
to support a range of macOS versions, continue to target
for and build on the oldest version in the range; for 3.8.x, the
``universal2`` variant is only useful on macOS 11 or later.
