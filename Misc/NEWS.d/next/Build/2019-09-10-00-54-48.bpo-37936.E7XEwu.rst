The :file:`.gitignore` file systematically keeps "rooted", with a
non-trailing slash, all the rules that are meant to apply to files in a
specific place in the repo.  Previously, when the intended file to ignore
happened to be at the root of the repo, we'd most often accidentally also
ignore files and directories with the same name anywhere in the tree.
