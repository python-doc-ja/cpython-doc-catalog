Update optional extension module detection for AIX.
ossaudiodev and spwd are not applicable for AIX, and
are no longer reported as missing.
3rd-party packaging of ncurses (with ASIS support)
conflicts with officially supported AIX curses library,
so configure AIX to use libcurses.a. However, skip
trying to build _curses_panel.
