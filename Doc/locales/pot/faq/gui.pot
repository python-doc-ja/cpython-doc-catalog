msgid "Standard builds of Python include an object-oriented interface to the Tcl/Tk widget set, called Tkinter.  This is probably the easiest to install and use. For more info about Tk, including pointers to the source, see the Tcl/Tk home page at https://www.tcl.tk.  Tcl/Tk is fully portable to the Mac OS X, Windows, and Unix platforms."

msgid "wxWidgets (https://www.wxwidgets.org) is a free, portable GUI class library written in C++ that provides a native look and feel on a number of platforms, with Windows, Mac OS X, GTK, X11, all listed as current stable targets.  Language bindings are available for a number of languages including Python, Perl, Ruby, etc."

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:36
msgid "wxPython (http://www.wxpython.org) is the Python binding for wxwidgets.  While it often lags slightly behind the official wxWidgets releases, it also offers a number of features via pure Python extensions that are not available in other language bindings.  There is an active wxPython user and developer community."

PyQt is currently more mature than PySide, but you must buy a PyQt license from `Riverbank Computing <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/commercial/license-faq>`_ if you want to write proprietary applications.  PySide is free for all applications."

msgid "How do I freeze Tkinter applications?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:97
msgid "Freeze is a tool to create stand-alone applications.  When freezing Tkinter applications, the applications will not be truly stand-alone, as the application will still need the Tcl and Tk libraries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:101
msgid "One solution is to ship the application with the Tcl and Tk libraries, and point to them at run-time using the :envvar:`TCL_LIBRARY` and :envvar:`TK_LIBRARY` environment variables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:105
msgid "To get truly stand-alone applications, the Tcl scripts that form the library have to be integrated into the application as well. One tool supporting that is SAM (stand-alone modules), which is part of the Tix distribution (http://tix.sourceforge.net/)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:110
msgid "Build Tix with SAM enabled, perform the appropriate call to :c:func:`Tclsam_init`, etc. inside Python's :file:`Modules/tkappinit.c`, and link with libtclsam and libtksam (you might include the Tix libraries as well)."

msgid "Can I have Tk events handled while waiting for I/O?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:119
msgid "On platforms other than Windows, yes, and you don't even need threads!  But you'll have to restructure your I/O code a bit.  Tk has the equivalent of Xt's :c:func:`XtAddInput()` call, which allows you to register a callback function which will be called from the Tk mainloop when I/O is possible on a file descriptor.  See :ref:`tkinter-file-handlers`."

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:129
msgid "An often-heard complaint is that event handlers bound to events with the :meth:`bind` method don't get handled even when the appropriate key is pressed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/gui.rst:132
msgid "The most common cause is that the widget to which the binding applies doesn't have \"keyboard focus\".  Check out the Tk documentation for the focus command. Usually a widget is given the keyboard focus by clicking in it (but not for labels; see the takefocus option)."
