msgid "The :mod:`glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order.  No tilde expansion is done, but ``*``, ``?``, and character ranges expressed with ``[]`` will be correctly matched.  This is done by using the :func:`os.scandir` and :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions in concert, and not by actually invoking a subshell.  Note that unlike :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch`, :mod:`glob` treats filenames beginning with a dot (``.``) as special cases. (For tilde and shell variable expansion, use :func:`os.path.expanduser` and :func:`os.path.expandvars`.)"

msgid "Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match *pathname*, which must be a string containing a path specification. *pathname* can be either absolute (like :file:`/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like :file:`../../Tools/\\*/\\*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell). Whether or not the results are sorted depends on the file system."
