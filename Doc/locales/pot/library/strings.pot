msgid "In addition, Python's built-in string classes support the sequence type methods described in the :ref:`typesseq` section, and also the string-specific methods described in the :ref:`string-methods` section. To output formatted strings use template strings or the ``%`` operator described in the :ref:`string-formatting` section.
