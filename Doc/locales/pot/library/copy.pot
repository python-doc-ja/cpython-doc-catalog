msgid ":mod:`copy` --- Shallow and deep copy operations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/copy.rst:7
msgid "Assignment statements in Python do not copy objects, they create bindings between a target and an object. For collections that are mutable or contain mutable items, a copy is sometimes needed so one can change one copy without changing the other. This module provides generic shallow and deep copy operations (explained below)."

msgid "A *shallow copy* constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts *references* into it to the objects found in the original."

msgid "A *deep copy* constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts *copies* into it of the objects found in the original."

msgid "Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don't exist with shallow copy operations:"

msgid "Recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly, contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop."

msgstr ""

#: ../../library/copy.rst:57
msgid "This module does not copy types like module, method, stack trace, stack frame, file, socket, window, array, or any similar types.  It does \"copy\" functions and classes (shallow and deeply), by returning the original object unchanged; this is compatible with the way these are treated by the :mod:`pickle` module."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/copy.rst:62
msgid "Shallow copies of dictionaries can be made using :meth:`dict.copy`, and of lists by assigning a slice of the entire list, for example, ``copied_list = original_list[:]``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../library/copy.rst:80
msgid "In order for a class to define its own copy implementation, it can define special methods :meth:`__copy__` and :meth:`__deepcopy__`.  The former is called to implement the shallow copy operation; no additional arguments are passed. The latter is called to implement the deep copy operation; it is passed one argument, the memo dictionary.  If the :meth:`__deepcopy__` implementation needs to make a deep copy of a component, it should call the :func:`deepcopy` function with the component as first argument and the memo dictionary as second argument."
