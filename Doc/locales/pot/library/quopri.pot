msgid "This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding, as defined in :rfc:`1521`: \"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies\". The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data where there are relatively few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding scheme available via the :mod:`base64` module is more compact if there are many such characters, as when sending a graphics file."

msgid "Decode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting decoded binary data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must either be file objects or objects that mimic the file object interface. *input* will be read until ``input.readline()`` returns an empty string. If the optional argument *header* is present and true, underscore will be decoded as space. This is used to decode \"Q\"-encoded headers as described in :rfc:`1522`: \"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Two: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text\"."

Note that spaces and tabs appearing at the end of lines are always encoded, as per :rfc:`1521`."
