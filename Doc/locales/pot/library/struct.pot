This behavior is chosen so that the bytes of a packed struct correspond exactly to the layout in memory of the corresponding C struct.  To handle platform-independent data formats or omit implicit pad bytes, use ``standard`` size and alignment instead of ``native`` size and alignment: see :ref:`struct-alignment` for details."
