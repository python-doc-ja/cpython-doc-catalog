msgid "Beep the PC's speaker. The *frequency* parameter specifies frequency, in hertz, of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767. The *duration* parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the sound should last.  If the system is not able to beep the speaker, :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised."

msgid "Call the underlying :c:func:`PlaySound` function from the Platform API.  The *sound* parameter may be a filename, audio data as a string, or ``None``.  Its interpretation depends on the value of *flags*, which can be a bitwise ORed combination of the constants described below. If the *sound* parameter is ``None``, any currently playing waveform sound is stopped. If the system indicates an error, :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised."

msgid "Call the underlying :c:func:`MessageBeep` function from the Platform API.  This plays a sound as specified in the registry.  The *type* argument specifies which sound to play; possible values are ``-1``, ``MB_ICONASTERISK``, ``MB_ICONEXCLAMATION``, ``MB_ICONHAND``, ``MB_ICONQUESTION``, and ``MB_OK``, all described below.  The value ``-1`` produces a \"simple beep\"; this is the final fallback if a sound cannot be played otherwise."
