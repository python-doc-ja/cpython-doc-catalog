Instead of nested entities it repeats one large entity with a couple of thousand chars over and over again.

The :mod:`defusedexpat` module still allows a sane and configurable amount of entity expansions. The modifications may be included in some future release of Python, but will not be included in any bugfix releases of Python because they break backward compatibility."
