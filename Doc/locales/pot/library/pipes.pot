msgid "The :mod:`pipes` module defines a class to abstract the concept of a *pipeline* --- a sequence of converters from one file to  another."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pipes.rst:16
msgid "Because the module uses :program:`/bin/sh` command lines, a POSIX or compatible shell for :func:`os.system` and :func:`os.popen` is required."

msgid "Prior to Python 2.7, this function was not publicly documented.  It is finally exposed publicly in Python 3.3 as the :func:`quote <shlex.quote>` function in the :mod:`shlex` module."

#: ../../library/pipes.rst:43
msgid "Return a shell-escaped version of the string *s*.  The returned value is a string that can safely be used as one token in a shell command line, for cases where you cannot use a list."

#: ../../library/pipes.rst:103
msgid "The first letter can be either of ``'-'`` (which means the command reads its standard input), ``'f'`` (which means the commands reads a given file on the command line) or ``'.'`` (which means the commands reads no input, and hence must be first.)"

#: ../../library/pipes.rst:108
msgid "Similarly, the second letter can be either of ``'-'`` (which means  the command writes to standard output), ``'f'`` (which means the  command writes a file on the command line) or ``'.'`` (which means the command does not write anything, and hence must be last.)"
