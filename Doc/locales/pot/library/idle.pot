Enter ``import tkinter as tk; root = tk.Tk()`` in standard Python and nothing appears.  Enter the same in IDLE and a tk window appears.  In standard Python, one must also enter ``root.update()`` to see the window.  IDLE does the equivalent in the background, about 20 times a second, which is about every 50 milliseconds. Next enter ``b = tk.Button(root, text='button'); b.pack()``.  Again, nothing visibly changes in standard Python until one enters ``root.update()``."

msgid "If IDLE is started with the -n command line switch it will run in a single process and will not create the subprocess which runs the RPC Python execution server.  This can be useful if Python cannot create the subprocess or the RPC socket interface on your platform.  However, in this mode user code is not isolated from IDLE itself.  Also, the environment is not restarted when Run/Run Module (F5) is selected.  If your code has been modified, you must reload() the affected modules and re-import any specific items (e.g. from foo import baz) if the changes are to take effect.  For these reasons, it is preferable to run IDLE with the default subprocess if at all possible."
