msgid "This module provides basic mechanisms for measuring and controlling system resources utilized by a program."

msgid "Resource Limits"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/resource.rst:30
msgid "Resources usage can be limited using the :func:`setrlimit` function described below. Each resource is controlled by a pair of limits: a soft limit and a hard limit. The soft limit is the current limit, and may be lowered or raised by a process over time. The soft limit can never exceed the hard limit. The hard limit can be lowered to any value greater than the soft limit, but not raised. (Only processes with the effective UID of the super-user can raise a hard limit.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/resource.rst:38
msgid "The specific resources that can be limited are system dependent. They are described in the :manpage:`getrlimit(2)` man page.  The resources listed below are supported when the underlying operating system supports them; resources which cannot be checked or controlled by the operating system are not defined in this module for those platforms."

msgid "Sets new limits of consumption of *resource*. The *limits* argument must be a tuple ``(soft, hard)`` of two integers describing the new limits. A value of :data:`~resource.RLIM_INFINITY` can be used to request a limit that is unlimited."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/resource.rst:64
msgid "Raises :exc:`ValueError` if an invalid resource is specified, if the new soft limit exceeds the hard limit, or if a process tries to raise its hard limit. Specifying a limit of :data:`~resource.RLIM_INFINITY` when the hard or system limit for that resource is not unlimited will result in a :exc:`ValueError`.  A process with the effective UID of super-user can request any valid limit value, including unlimited, but :exc:`ValueError` will still be raised if the requested limit exceeds the system imposed limit."

msgid "The Unix man page for :manpage:`getrlimit(2)` lists the available resources. Note that not all systems use the same symbol or same value to denote the same resource.  This module does not attempt to mask platform differences --- symbols not defined for a platform will not be available from this module on that platform."

msgid "The fields of the return value each describe how a particular system resource has been used, e.g. amount of time spent running is user mode or number of times the process was swapped out of main memory. Some values are dependent on the clock tick internal, e.g. the amount of memory the process is using."
