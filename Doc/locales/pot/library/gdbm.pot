msgid "The :mod:`gdbm` module has been renamed to :mod:`dbm.gnu` in Python 3.  The :term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3."

#: ../../library/gdbm.rst:16
msgid "This module is quite similar to the :mod:`dbm` module, but uses ``gdbm`` instead to provide some additional functionality.  Please note that the file formats created by ``gdbm`` and ``dbm`` are incompatible."

#: ../../library/gdbm.rst:20
msgid "The :mod:`gdbm` module provides an interface to the GNU DBM library.  ``gdbm`` objects behave like mappings (dictionaries), except that keys and values are always strings. Printing a ``gdbm`` object doesn't print the keys and values, and the :meth:`items` and :meth:`values` methods are not supported."
