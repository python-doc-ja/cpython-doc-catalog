In addition, Python's built-in string classes support the sequence type methods described in the :ref:`typesseq` section, and also the string-specific methods described in the :ref:`string-methods` section. To output formatted strings use template strings or the ``%`` operator described in the :ref:`string-formatting` section.

Because *arg_name* is not quote-delimited, it is not possible to specify arbitrary dictionary keys (e.g., the strings ``'10'`` or ``':-]'``) within a format string. The *arg_name* can be followed by any number of index or attribute expressions. An expression of the form ``'.name'`` selects the named attribute using :func:`getattr`, while an expression of the form ``'[index]'`` does an index lookup using :func:`__getitem__`."

By converting the value to a string before calling :meth:`__format__`, the normal formatting logic is bypassed."
