#: ../../howto/descriptor.rst:445
msgid "In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with \"binding behavior\", one whose attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor protocol.  Those methods are :meth:`__get__`, :meth:`__set__`, and :meth:`__delete__`.  If any of those methods are defined for an object, it is said to be a :term:`descriptor`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/descriptor.rst:451
msgid "The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the attribute from an object's dictionary.  For instance, ``a.x`` has a lookup chain starting with ``a.__dict__['x']``, then ``type(a).__dict__['x']``, and continuing through the base classes of ``type(a)``. If the looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor methods, then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor method instead. Where this occurs in the precedence chain depends on which descriptor methods were defined."

msgid "Descriptors are a powerful, general purpose protocol.  They are the mechanism behind properties, methods, static methods, class methods, and :func:`super()`.
