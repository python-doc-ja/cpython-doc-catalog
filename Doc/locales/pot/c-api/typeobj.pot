msgid "Perhaps one of the most important structures of the Python object system is the structure that defines a new type: the :c:type:`PyTypeObject` structure.  Type objects can be handled using any of the :c:func:`PyObject_\\*` or :c:func:`PyType_\\*` functions, but do not offer much that's interesting to most Python applications. These objects are fundamental to how objects behave, so they are very important to the interpreter itself and to any extension module that implements new types."

msgid "Type objects are fairly large compared to most of the standard types. The reason for the size is that each type object stores a large number of values, mostly C function pointers, each of which implements a small part of the type's functionality.  The fields of the type object are examined in detail in this section.  The fields will be described in the order in which they occur in the structure."

The value of N is typically stored in the instance's :attr:`ob_size` field.  There are exceptions:  for example, long ints use a negative :attr:`ob_size` to indicate a negative number, and N is ``abs(ob_size)`` there.  Also, the presence of an :attr:`ob_size` field in the instance layout doesn't mean that the instance structure is variable-length (for example, the structure for the list type has fixed-length instances, yet those instances have a meaningful :attr:`ob_size` field)."

If the flag is present, :attr:`bf_getcharbuffer` may be *NULL*, indicating that the object's contents cannot be used as *8-bit characters*. The slot function may also raise an error if the object's contents cannot be interpreted as 8-bit characters. For example, if the object is an array which is configured to hold floating point values, an exception may be raised if a caller attempts to use :attr:`bf_getcharbuffer` to fetch a sequence of 8-bit characters. This notion of exporting the internal buffers as \"text\" is used to distinguish between objects that are binary in nature, and those which have character-based content."
