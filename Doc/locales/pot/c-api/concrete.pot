msgid "The functions in this chapter are specific to certain Python object types. Passing them an object of the wrong type is not a good idea; if you receive an object from a Python program and you are not sure that it has the right type, you must perform a type check first; for example, to check that an object is a dictionary, use :c:func:`PyDict_Check`.  The chapter is structured like the \"family tree\" of Python object types."

msgid "While the functions described in this chapter carefully check the type of the objects which are passed in, many of them do not check for *NULL* being passed instead of a valid object.  Allowing *NULL* to be passed in can cause memory access violations and immediate termination of the interpreter."
