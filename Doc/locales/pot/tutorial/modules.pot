msgid "If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead.  This is known as creating a *script*.  As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance.  You may also want to use a handy function that you've written in several programs without copying its definition into each program."
