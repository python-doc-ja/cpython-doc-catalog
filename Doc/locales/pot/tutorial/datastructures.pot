msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:453
msgid "Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are :term:`immutable`, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of :func:`namedtuples <collections.namedtuple>`). Lists are :term:`mutable`, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list."

msgid "A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these.  Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective.  For example::"

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:542
msgid "Another useful data type built into Python is the *dictionary* (see :ref:`typesmapping`). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as \"associative memories\" or \"associative arrays\".  Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by *keys*, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys.  Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can't use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like :meth:`append` and :meth:`extend`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:553
msgid "It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of *key: value* pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: ``{}``. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:559
msgid "The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key.  It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with ``del``. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten.  It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/datastructures.rst:565
msgid "The :meth:`keys` method of a dictionary object returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in arbitrary order (if you want it sorted, just apply the :func:`sorted` function to it).  To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the :keyword:`in` keyword."

The operators ``is`` and ``is not`` compare whether two objects are really the same object; this only matters for mutable objects like lists.  All comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all numerical operators."

These have lower priorities than comparison operators; between them, ``not`` has the highest priority and ``or`` the lowest, so that ``A and not B or C`` is equivalent to ``(A and (not B)) or C``. As always, parentheses can be used to express the desired composition."
msgstr ""

If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively.  If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one.  Lexicographical ordering for strings uses the ASCII ordering for individual characters.  Some examples of comparisons between sequences of the same type::"
